# Javascript screener for COVID-19

Evaluate a person or yourself with this easy covid-19 screener. Take it a step higher and implement your own web-wooks to send the survey data anywhere else. 
This Covid-19 screening web app is built on Javascript & JQuery. It won't need a dedicated server to work. You can run it directly from a web browser.
A really neat touch is the no-scroll design, dynamically adjusted desktop/mobile view & the smooth animations.

Go ahead and use this project in your own work. Whether that be for a small business or surveying yourself just for the heck of it.

Before you use it for practical screening purposes, take a look in the `js/script.js` file and modify the evaluation portion of the script.
It's as accurate as it should be to the best of my knowledge, but you could want something different.

TL;DR A Covid-19 screener built using Javascript & JQuery. Evaluation portion can/should be modified to your liking & flexibility.
